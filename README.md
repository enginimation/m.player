# m.Player - offline browser music player
m.Player build on top of the HTML5 technologies and wonderful javascript libraries. Currently you can find it only in Chrome Web Store(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lhjjnnhpfomdbcgnmkejhacbcdppljic) but hopefully we will change it soon.


## Feedback
There are a lot of features I would like to see in this player. You can help to make project better contributing your code or just sending your feedback. If you miss some functionality you are welcome to write me on anton.podviaznikov@enginimation.info. 

List of issues/features can be found here (https://github.com/podviaznikov/m.player/issues). However I personally plan to implement much more useful functions.
